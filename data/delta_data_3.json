    "question": "You are a professional assistant, please answer the questions according to the given materials.\nMaterials:\nBrief comment on the event\nOn June 2, 24, CEO Huang Renxun gave a keynote speech on AI development and AI application at Taipei International Computer Show (COMPUTEX). We summarized some viewpoints and analysis as follows:\n1) AI drives a new round of industrial revolution, and the world is transforming to accelerated computing. The demand for global computing is increasing year by year, GPU has stronger parallel computing ability, and the combination of GPU and CPU achieves a high-performance, low-power computing mode. When traditional computing models are stuck in bottlenecks such as energy and computing power, the company is driving the transformation of industries around the world to accelerated computing.\n2) The PC industry is embracing AI. The traditional PC industry is based on hardware such as CPU and GPU, and uses software as a medium to realize various operations. As early as 2012, the company began to use GPU for in-depth learning, until the Transformer model in 2016 and the birth of ChatGPT in 2022, generative AI began to appear. AI factory generates token,token generates all kinds of text, pictures, music, videos, etc. However, the traditional PC industry with hardware foundation such as CPU and GPU also faces the opportunity of change. The cloud model in AI PC has turned to the local model to improve the consumer experience. The turning point of the industrial chain has come.\n3) Product iteration continues to accelerate, the company in AI chips, network equipment and other hardware. In his speech, CEO Huang Renxun focused on the recent progress of AI chips and network facilities. The company plans to mass produce Blackwell GPU in 2024. Blackwell Ultra GPU and Spectrum Ultra X800 will be launched in 2025. In 2026, the next generation platform Rubin will be launched, including Rubin GPU(8 SHBM4), Vera CPU, NVLink 6 Switch(3.6T), CX9 Super NIC(1.6T), X1600 IB/Ethernet Switch; RubinUltra GPU(12S HBM4) will be launched in 2027. The company reiterated the product iteration route, the company will adhere to the data center size, one-year pace, technical limitations, one-architecture route, that is, adhere to the use of the strongest performance of the semiconductor process process at the time, to update the product at a one-year pace, with a unified architecture to cover the entire data center product line. The company has compressed the product iteration cycle to one generation, maximizing the release of the current technical limits of the product, and we continue to be optimistic about the company's competitive advantage in the AI field.\nProfit forecast\nWe expect the company's net profit for 24-26 to be $685.67/1038.9/139.78 billion, corresponding to EPS of $27.43/41.56/55.91, and continue to maintain a buy rating.\nRisk Alert\nEnd demand is not as good as expected, AI development is not as good as expected, and the United States has increased sanctions against China.\n\nQuestion:\nSummarize the main factors that contribute to the international sugar price forecast adjusting down to 19.5-23 cents per pound.\n\nPlease give your answer:\n",
    "answer": "The main factors contributing to the adjustment of the international sugar price forecast down to 19.5-23 cents per pound include a significant increase in sugarcane yield in the south, recovery of national sugar production growth, and improved international sugar supply expectations."
