    "question": "You are a professional assistant, please answer the questions according to the given materials.\nMaterials:\nWhite sugar: Thanks to the significant increase in sugarcane yield in the south, the recovery of national sugar production growth, international sugar supply expectations tend to improve, the international sugar price forecast range down to 19.5-23 cents/pound. Due to the improvement of sugar planting benefits and the prominent comparative advantages with competitive crops, farmers' enthusiasm for planting has increased, and the weather conditions are generally normal. In 2024/25, the sown area of sugarcane was flat and slightly increased, the sown area of sugar beet increased significantly, the sugar output maintained a restorative growth, which is expected to increase to 11 million tons, the consumption was basically flat, and the domestic sugar production and demand gap narrowed.\nCotton: Affected by the price difference, cotton imports continued to be high, reaching 2.14 million tons from September 2023 to March 2024. In 2024/25, China's cotton planting area was 2747 thousand hectares (41.202 million mu), a decrease of 1.5 from the previous year. Xinjiang cotton target price subsidy policy is stable, cotton farmers have a high enthusiasm for cotton planting, considering the constraints of water and soil resources, the sub-suitable cotton areas withdraw in an orderly manner, and the area is stable and slightly reduced. The area of the inland cotton area continued to decline due to factors such as low comparative efficiency and difficulty in mechanization promotion. During the period of cotton sowing and emergence, the comprehensive climatic conditions in the main producing areas are suitable, and the unit yield is expected to be 2031kg per hectare (135kg per mu), an increase of 0.8 over the previous year. Cotton production was 5.58 million tons, a decrease of 0.7 per cent over the previous year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that the global economic growth rate will remain at about 3.2 in 2024 and 2025, the domestic and foreign economies will continue to improve, and the market is expected to increase the recovery of cotton consumption. It is estimated that China's cotton consumption in the new year will be 7.8 million tons, an increase of 1.4 over the previous year, the import volume will be 2 million tons, and the final inventory will drop to 7.57 million tons. Overall wait-and-see.\n\nQuestion:\nSummarize the main factors that contribute to the international sugar price forecast adjusting down to 19.5-23 cents per pound.\n\nPlease give your answer:\n",
    "answer": "The main factors contributing to the adjustment of the international sugar price forecast down to 19.5-23 cents per pound include a significant increase in sugarcane yield in the south, recovery of national sugar production growth, and improved international sugar supply expectations."
