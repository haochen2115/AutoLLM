viewpoint and suggestion]
The macro pace slowed this week, with copper-led non-ferrous varieties falling from their overall highs and tin prices following suit. However, relatively speaking, we still maintain a strong judgment on the fundamentals of tin. When Myanmar's resumption of production is expected to be delayed, the country is facing a trend of tight raw materials. Although the processing fee is high due to the influence of high tin price to a certain extent, this week Yunnan has also entered the production shutdown and maintenance one after another, which also implies the tightening of production in the future. This week's social inventory of 18761 tons, compared with last week's 650 tons to the warehouse, to the warehouse inflection point appeared, the expected tight supply will be realized at the realistic level, the tin price will have a further positive impact. But the overall non-ferrous plate is facing adjustment, tin is also difficult to independently out of the rising market.
We suggest that after a short-term adjustment, there may still be room for an upward shift in the center of gravity of the tin price."
2,"White sugar: Thanks to the significant increase in sugarcane yield in the south, the recovery of national sugar production growth, international sugar supply expectations tend to improve, the international sugar price forecast range down to 19.5-23 cents/pound. Due to the improvement of sugar planting benefits and the prominent comparative advantages with competitive crops, farmers' enthusiasm for planting has increased, and the weather conditions are generally normal. In 2024/25, the sown area of sugarcane was flat and slightly increased, the sown area of sugar beet increased significantly, the sugar output maintained a restorative growth, which is expected to increase to 11 million tons, the consumption was basically flat, and the domestic sugar production and demand gap narrowed.
Cotton: Affected by the price difference, cotton imports continued to be high, reaching 2.14 million tons from September 2023 to March 2024. In 2024/25, China's cotton planting area was 2747 thousand hectares (41.202 million mu), a decrease of 1.5 from the previous year. Xinjiang cotton target price subsidy policy is stable, cotton farmers have a high enthusiasm for cotton planting, considering the constraints of water and soil resources, the sub-suitable cotton areas withdraw in an orderly manner, and the area is stable and slightly reduced. The area of the inland cotton area continued to decline due to factors such as low comparative efficiency and difficulty in mechanization promotion. During the period of cotton sowing and emergence, the comprehensive climatic conditions in the main producing areas are suitable, and the unit yield is expected to be 2031kg per hectare (135kg per mu), an increase of 0.8 over the previous year. Cotton production was 5.58 million tons, a decrease of 0.7 per cent over the previous year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that the global economic growth rate will remain at about 3.2 in 2024 and 2025, the domestic and foreign economies will continue to improve, and the market is expected to increase the recovery of cotton consumption. It is estimated that China's cotton consumption in the new year will be 7.8 million tons, an increase of 1.4 over the previous year, the import volume will be 2 million tons, and the final inventory will drop to 7.57 million tons. Overall wait-and-see."
3,"Brief comment on the event
On June 2, 24, CEO Huang Renxun gave a keynote speech on AI development and AI application at Taipei International Computer Show (COMPUTEX). We summarized some viewpoints and analysis as follows:
1) AI drives a new round of industrial revolution, and the world is transforming to accelerated computing. The demand for global computing is increasing year by year, GPU has stronger parallel computing ability, and the combination of GPU and CPU achieves a high-performance, low-power computing mode. When traditional computing models are stuck in bottlenecks such as energy and computing power, the company is driving the transformation of industries around the world to accelerated computing.
2) The PC industry is embracing AI. The traditional PC industry is based on hardware such as CPU and GPU, and uses software as a medium to realize various operations. As early as 2012, the company began to use GPU for in-depth learning, until the Transformer model in 2016 and the birth of ChatGPT in 2022, generative AI began to appear. AI factory generates token,token generates all kinds of text, pictures, music, videos, etc. However, the traditional PC industry with hardware foundation such as CPU and GPU also faces the opportunity of change. The cloud model in AI PC has turned to the local model to improve the consumer experience. The turning point of the industrial chain has come.
3) Product iteration continues to accelerate, the company in AI chips, network equipment and other hardware. In his speech, CEO Huang Renxun focused on the recent progress of AI chips and network facilities. The company plans to mass produce Blackwell GPU in 2024. Blackwell Ultra GPU and Spectrum Ultra X800 will be launched in 2025. In 2026, the next generation platform Rubin will be launched, including Rubin GPU(8 SHBM4), Vera CPU, NVLink 6 Switch(3.6T), CX9 Super NIC(1.6T), X1600 IB/Ethernet Switch; RubinUltra GPU(12S HBM4) will be launched in 2027. The company reiterated the product iteration route, the company will adhere to the data center size, one-year pace, technical limitations, one-architecture route, that is, adhere to the use of the strongest performance of the semiconductor process process at the time, to update the product at a one-year pace, with a unified architecture to cover the entire data center product line. The company has compressed the product iteration cycle to one generation, maximizing the release of the current technical limits of the product, and we continue to be optimistic about the company's competitive advantage in the AI field.
Profit forecast
We expect the company's net profit for 24-26 to be $685.67/1038.9/139.78 billion, corresponding to EPS of $27.43/41.56/55.91, and continue to maintain a buy rating.
Risk Alert
End demand is not as good as expected, AI development is not as good as expected, and the United States has increased sanctions against China."
